Whenever there was a speaker (Instructor or an invited speaker), there were Readings assigned that had to be read by the students. The table below shows some of the Readings. Whenever there was no speaker, key papers were assigned to the students. The students had to make presentations based on these papers. These presentations along with class participation determined the final grade.

All assignments are due 3 weeks after Lec #14 (last lecture).
